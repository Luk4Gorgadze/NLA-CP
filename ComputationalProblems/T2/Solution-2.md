## 1.2.  Implementation of k-means clustering for model problem (2 points)
* (a)  Formulate problem including input data and suitable matrix or vector norm(s)
* (b)  Solve the problem using k-means clustering
* (c)  Perform numerical experiments on how selection of different norms and  starting  centers  or  number  of  clusters  affect  the solution, number of iterations, convergence or divergence
* (d)  Test:  your code should work properly on data provided by TA.
* (e)  Notice:  0 points is assigned to a model problem provided twiceby  students.   Make  sure,  your  model  is  different  from  modelsprovided by others.

### Conclusion:
* a) For CP1 1.2 Iâ€™ll be using a dataset from Nasa exoplanet science institute to gather information about planetary systems that are outside of the solar system and with the help of K means clustering Iâ€™ll collect similar planets in relevant groups. I believe my project will help cosmic researchers to classify old and newly discovered planets according to their parameters. 

* b) Solved it using K means algorithm âœ… 
* c) As you can see, number of clusters highly affect calculation time, after 50 clusters it might take up to 1 minute to run the program. I divided planets in groups based on 7 parameters, using k means, but plotted them with only 3 parameters. My pseudo visualisation gives same color to similar planets, and lastly, My clustering algorithm will always converge if number of Ks is between 1-600.
* d) You can add data to my csv file and I will be able to use it
* e) My model is **authentic** ðŸ¤£
